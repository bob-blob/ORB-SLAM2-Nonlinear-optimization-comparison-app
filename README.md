# Comparison Framework for Nonlinear optimization methods in ORB-SLAM
Application that allows user to launch ORB-SLAM tasks with configurable set of nonlinear optimization methods. This app was developed as the part of the Bachelor Thesis project in Innopolis University under the supervision of Ilya Afanasyev in Robotics laboratory.

Probably you'll need to fix some paths in order to get this thingy work. 

Sorry, there is no documentation for the setup yet. And the project itself is quite raw and there are a lot of things to be done. We will try to clean up the mess and add documenation as soon as we'll find the time to do it.
